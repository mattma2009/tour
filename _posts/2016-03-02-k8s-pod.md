**Cluster**

cluster is a set of physical or virtual machines and other infrastructure resources used by Kubernetes to run your applications.

**Node**

node is a physical or virtual machine running Kubernetes, onto which pods can be scheduled.

**Pod**

pod is a co-located group of containers and volumes.

**Label**

label is a key/value pair that is attached to a resource, such as a pod, to convey a user-defined identifying attribute. Labels can be used to organize and to select subsets of resources.

**Selector**

selector is an expression that matches labels in order to identify related resources, such as which pods are targeted by a load-balanced service.

**Replication Controller**

replication controller ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any one time. It both allows for easy scaling of replicated systems and handles re-creation of a pod when the machine it is on reboots or otherwise fails.

**Service**

service defines a set of pods and a means by which to access them, such as single stable IP address and corresponding DNS name.

**Volume**

volume is a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to a Container as part of its filesystem. Kubernetes volumes build upon Docker Volumes, adding provisioning of the volume directory and/or device.

**Secret**

secret stores sensitive data, such as authentication tokens, which can be made available to containers upon request.

**Name**

user- or client-provided name for a resource.

**Namespace**

namespace is like a prefix to the name of a resource. Namespaces help different projects, teams, or customers to share a cluster, such as by preventing name collisions between unrelated teams.

**Annotation**

key/value pair that can hold larger (compared to a label), and possibly not human-readable, data, intended to store non-identifying auxiliary data, especially data manipulated by tools and system extensions. Efficient filtering by annotation values is not supported
